Optional and non-repeating. To avoid any possible ambiguity, use of this default is deprecated, but any default supplied will be assumed for all prices in Group&#160;P.26 which do not specify the Price type explicitly. It is strongly recommended that the price type should be specified in the &lt;Price&gt; composite for each individual price.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t",
