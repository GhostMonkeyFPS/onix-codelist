Repeatable in order to describe multiple constraints on usage.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The Price constraint composite has the same structure as &lt;EpubUsageConstraint&gt;. Use &lt;EpubUsageConstraint&gt; for constraints that limit the user experience of the product, whether or not they are enforced by technical protection measures (DRM). Use &lt;PriceConstraint&gt; where a single product is available under multiple terms and conditions (<i>ie</i>&#160;multiple commercial offers for the same product which differ in their Price constraints, and whether or not they are enforced by DRM).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
