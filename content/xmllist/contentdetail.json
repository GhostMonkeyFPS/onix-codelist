The more usual ONIX practice is to send a table of contents as text, possibly in XHTML, in Group&#160;P.14.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>When used, the block should normally contain at least one instance of &lt;ContentItem&gt;. It may be empty <em>only</em> within a partial or &#8216;block update&#8217; (Notification or update type&#160;04, see&#160;P.1.2), when the intention is to remove all previously-supplied content detail.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t",
