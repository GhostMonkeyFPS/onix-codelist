    "Description": "<p>An ONIX code indicating the default language which is assumed for the text content of products listed in the message, unless the language is explicitly stated by sending a &#8216;language of text&#8217; in Group&#160;P.10 of each Product record. Optional and non-repeating. To avoid any possible ambiguity, use of this default is deprecated, but any default supplied will be assumed for all Product records which do not specify the language of the text explicitly in Group&#160;P.10. It is strongly recommended that the language of the text should be specified in the &lt;Language&gt; composite for each product.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t",
