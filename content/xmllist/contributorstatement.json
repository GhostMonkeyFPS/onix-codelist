The <i>language</i> attribute is optional for a single instance of &lt;ContributorStatement&gt;, but must be included in each instance if &lt;ContributorStatement&gt; is repeated. When the &lt;ContributorStatement&gt; field is sent, the receiver should use it to replace all name detail (though not the biographical, date or place details) sent in the &lt;Contributor&gt; composite for display purposes only. The individual name detail must also be sent in the &lt;Contributor&gt; composite for indexing and retrieval.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
