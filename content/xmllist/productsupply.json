    "Description": "<p>The product supply block covers data Groups P.24 to P.26, specifying a market, the publishing status and representation detail of the product in that market, and the supply arrangements for the product in that market. The &lt;ProductSupply&gt; composite is repeatable within the block to describe multiple markets. At least one occurrence is expected in a &lt;Product&gt; record unless the &lt;NotificationType&gt; in Group&#160;P.1 indicates that the record is a partial update notice which carries only those blocks in which changes have occurred.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Note that for many products with simple supply arrangements and a single market, many details of that market are &#8216;inherited&#8217; from Block&#160;4 and need not be repeated.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>",
