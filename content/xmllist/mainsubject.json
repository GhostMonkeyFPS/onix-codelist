The main category may be expressed in more than one subject scheme, <i>ie</i>&#160;there may be two or more instances of the &lt;Subject&gt; composite, using different schemes, each carrying the &lt;MainSubject/&gt; flag, so long as there is only one main category <em>per scheme</em> (<i>ie</i>&#160;per value of &lt;SubjectSchemeIdentifier&gt;). Optional, though for some subject schemes (<i>eg</i>&#160;<i>Thema</i>), &lt;MainSubject/&gt; can be vital in order to prevent potential misinterpretation of a group of subject codes, and for other schemes which by their nature only allow one code (<i>eg</i>&#160;Dewey), &lt;MainSubject&gt; is not relevant. Non-repeating in each occurrence of the &lt;Subject&gt; composite.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
