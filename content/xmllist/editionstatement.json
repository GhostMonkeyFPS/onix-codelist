Appropriate edition type and number must also be sent, for indexing and retrieval. An &lt;EditionStatement&gt; should be strictly limited to describing features of the content of the edition, and should <em>not</em> include aspects such as rights or market restrictions which are properly covered elsewhere in the ONIX record.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
