It may optionally contain one or more contributors to the event, listing those that are also contributors to the product using &lt;ContributorReference&gt; and those that are <em>not</em> contributors to the product using &lt;Contributor&gt;. If there are no contributors to the event of either type, an optional &lt;NoContributor/&gt; flag may be included instead.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
