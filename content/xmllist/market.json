    "Description": "<p>A group of data elements which together give details of a geographical territory and any non-geographical sales restrictions that apply within it. Optional in terms of the schema definitions, but required in most ONIX applications. If omitted, the geographical extent of the market must be assumed to be the area defined by the sales rights.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The &lt;Market&gt; composite is repeatable, but in almost all cases only a single instance is required. It may be repeated if a non-geographical sales restriction applies only to a <em>part</em> of a geographically-defined market&#160;&#8211; for example where a product is sold throughout the European Union, but exclusive to a single retailer in France.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
