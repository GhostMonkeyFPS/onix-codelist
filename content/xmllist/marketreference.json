It is intended to be used to label each repeat of &lt;ProductSupply&gt; for use in subsequent partial updates and reporting.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Note that the scope of the Market reference is limited to a single Product record &#8211;&#160;a geographically identical market for a different product may have a different Market reference, and a geographically different market in another Product record may use the same reference.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
