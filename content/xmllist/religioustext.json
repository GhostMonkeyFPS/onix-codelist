The &lt;ReligiousText&gt; composite may carry <em>either</em> a &lt;Bible&gt; composite <em>or</em> a &lt;ReligiousTextIdentifier&gt; element accompanied by multiple repeats of the &lt;ReligiousTextFeature&gt; composite. This approach is adopted to enable other devotional texts to be included if need arises without requiring a new ONIX release.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
