Must be preceded by at least one &lt;SalesRights&gt; composite.

Not repeatable. Note the value &#8216;00&#8217; should be used to indicate where sales rights are genuinely unknown, or are unstated for any reason&#160;&#8211; in this case, data recipients must not assume anything about the rights that are applicable.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The extended example below illustrates the use of &lt;SalesRights&gt; and &lt;ROWSalesRightsType&gt;.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
