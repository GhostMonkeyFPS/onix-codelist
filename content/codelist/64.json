Copies of books that are remaindered are often made available in the supply chain at a reduced price. However, such remainders are often sold under a product identifier that differs from the ISBN on the full-priced copy of the book. A Publishing Status code 10 \u2018Remaindered\u2019 on a given product record may or may not be followed by a Publishing Status code 06 \u2018Out of Stock Indefinitely\u2019 or 07 \u2018Out of Print\u2019: the practise varies from one publisher to another. Some publishers may revert to a Publishing Status code 04 \u2018Active\u2019 if a desired inventory level on the product in question has subsequently been reached.
