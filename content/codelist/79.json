If there are multiple sources for the same raw material, repeat <ProductFormFeature> for each plot. Further repeats of <ProductFormFeature> may be used for multiple paper, card and board types. <ProductFormFeatureValue> is a country code from List 91 indicating the country in which the source plot is, optionally followed by space and a date of harvest of the source plot (YYYY, YYYYMM or YYYYMMDD). <ProductFormFeatureDescription> is a list of points defining the plot from which the raw material was harvested, using GPS coordinates with 6 decimal places of precision (these are real numbers, \u00b190 for latitude [negative numbers indicate a latitude south of the equator], \u00b1180 excluding -180 itself for longitude [negative numbers indicate a longitude west of the Prime Greenwich meridian]). Latitude and Longitude for each point are space-separated, and multiple points are comma-separated. (Note these coordinates use decimal parts of a degree, not minutes and seconds.) ONE point defines the centre of a 4 hectare plot (200m \u00d7 200m). TWO points define a line joining opposite corners of a \u2018square\u2019 plot bounded by two lines of latitude and two of longitude. THREE or more points define a simple polygon outlining the plot. Lines and polygon edges may not cross a national boundary or the 180\u00b0 line of longitude. Polygon edges may not intersect. It is good practice to ensure the polygon is drawn clockwise and is \u2018closed\u2019 (that is, that the first and last points are identical, so that for example four points define a triangle). If not closed, the closing polygon edge is implied, and to avoid ambiguity, trailing zeros in the latitude and longitude should be explicit. Only for use in ONIX 3.0 or later",
